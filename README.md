# Corneal-Profiling and Power Computation-

## Introduction
The code attached herewith develops a 3D profile of cornea form the output of cornea scope, also called a "photo keratoscope". 
Generated data has 2D corneal profile with nine concentric ring which represents shape of the cornea. 

## Technologies

- Pandas 
- Matplotlib

## Language
- Python 

## Computes
- Corneal profile( height and tangent of anlge at differnt pixel value)
- Power at given pixel value
